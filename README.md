# Scripts

Bunch of scripts that I used to automate my workflow.

## File Creator.ps1

- it looks for a list.txt file inside the directory that the script is run in
- it iterates through each line in that text file and creates an empty file with the corresponding line as its filename

## Batch Icon Changer.ps1

- this script changes the folder icon of Folders under a certain directory to icon.ico file specified in each directory accordingly.
